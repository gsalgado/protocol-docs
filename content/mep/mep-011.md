# Remove unnecessary base64 encoding of PEM encoded data

## Abstract

The base64 encoding of PEM encoded data is redundant and should
be omitted.

## Current status

Asymmetric keys and signatures are encoded twice: first using
[PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail)
and then by applying plain [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)
encoding.

## Drawbacks

Since the PEM encoding already yields an ASCII output (namely
by applying base64 encoding) the repeated base64 encoding is functionally
completely redundant, complicates the opentxs message format, hurts the
readability of the opentxs message format and wastes CPU cycles.

## Enhancement

Remove the redundant base64 encoding.

## Impact

By removing the redundant base64 encoding of PEM encoded signatures and
asymmetric keys the opentxs message format will become simpler and more
readable. Furthermore, the processing power requirement for a notary and
an auditor can be decreased which benefits the amount of processed
transactions per second given a constant processing power.

In
[MEP-8](https://github.com/monetas/protocol-docs/blob/master/content/mep/mep-008.md)
the transition to ed25519 signatures has been decided. Since it will
completely replace the current RSA implementation the removal of
base64 encoding will also shorten the time to finalize MEP-8.
